# apodwall
Download todays APOD and set it as a wallpaper with description. 

Designed to work in GNOME environment.


## TODO:
- ✓ download APOD picture and extract explanation
- ✓ draw explanation on picture
- ✓ set picture as a wallpaper under gnome
- better draw so explanation always lands within the image
- behaviour for images smaller than screen
